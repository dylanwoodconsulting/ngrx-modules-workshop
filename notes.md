  - [ ] refCount true so no memory leak when component unsubs
- [ ] questions
  - [ ] how do you store state in local storage?
    - [ ] general questions on rehydration
  - [ ] ngOnInit vs inline vs constructor
    - [ ] if no input assignment, just do inline/constructor

  - [ ] nested smart components
    - [ ] nested action sending
  - [ ] scaling of actions
    - [x] good action hygiene still appropriate?
    - [ ] actions as state transitions
      - [ ] how much should be aggregated?
  - [ ] how to handle/test lots and lots of actions
  - [ ] shared feature state
  - [ ] action that affects multiple states
    - [ ] mutiple actions or bring same action to multiple reducers?

  - [x] alex okrushko, marko stanimirovic, brandon roberts
  - [ ] suggestions
    - [ ] break up ms like 20 \* 1000
      - [ ] aka 2 \* 60 \* 60 \* 1000
      - [ ] can also do 20_000
    - [ ] webpack vs esbuild vs vite (which also uses esbuild)
    - [ ] typescript style guide
      - [x] ts.dev
    - [ ] effects
      - [ ] add an explicit return to help with errors
      - [ ] can just add an inject() to each function
        - [ ] inject within the body to avoid jest branch issues
          - [ ] use testbed and/or mock inject with this method
      - [ ] easier to test by just passing mock actions, etc
    - [ ] actions
      - [ ] keep actions close to the source
      - [ ] actions don't target a specific reducer
      - [ ] are events
      - [ ] success + error/failure suffix
      - [ ] createActionGroup
    - [ ] selectors
      - [ ] abstract
        - [ ] typing of store
